## üìã Overview

This tool provides a simple method to verify backup completion by counting files on different servers and comparing the results. While not a comprehensive backup verification solution, matching file counts can indicate that backups have been successfully transferred between systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Multi-server support** - Compare file counts across unlimited servers
- üé® **Colorful output** - Easy-to-read results with color-coded information
- ‚è≥ **Progress indicators** - Visual feedback during file counting operations
- üîß **Easy configuration** - Simple array-based server configuration
- üìä **Clean reporting** - Formatted output with timestamps
- üîê **SSH-based** - Secure connections using existing SSH configurations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Bash shell (version 4.0 or higher)
- SSH client installed
- SSH access configured to target servers (preferably with key-based authentication)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backup-verification-tool.git
cd backup-verification-tool
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x verify-backups.sh
```

3. Configure your servers (see Configuration section below)

4. Run the script:
```bash
./verify-backups.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the `SERVERS` array in the script to include your server details:

```bash
SERVERS=(
    "Production Server|user@prod.example.com|/var/backups/daily"
    "Backup Server 1|user@backup1.example.com|/backup/storage/daily"
    "Backup Server 2|user@backup2.example.com|/mnt/backups/daily"
)
```

**Format:** `"Display Name|SSH User@Host|Path"`

- **Display Name**: Friendly name shown in the output
- **SSH User@Host**: SSH connection string (user@hostname or user@ip)
- **Path**: Absolute path to the directory containing files to count

### SSH Configuration

For best results, configure SSH key-based authentication:

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Copy public key to servers
ssh-copy-id user@server.example.com
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the script after configuration:

```bash
./verify-backups.sh
```

### Example Output

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

This tool provides basic verification with the following limitations:

- **File count only**: Doesn't verify file integrity, content, or checksums
- **No size verification**: Doesn't compare file sizes or detect corruption
- **No timestamp checks**: Doesn't verify file modification dates
- **Basic error handling**: Limited error reporting for failed connections

### For Critical Backups

Consider implementing additional verification methods:

- **Checksum verification**: Use `rsync --checksum` or similar tools
- **File integrity**: Implement hash-based verification (MD5, SHA256)
- **Content validation**: Test restore procedures regularly
- **Monitoring integration**: Connect with monitoring systems for alerts

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**SSH Connection Failures:**
- Verify SSH access: `ssh user@server.example.com`
- Check SSH key authentication
- Ensure servers are reachable

**Permission Denied:**
- Verify user has read access to specified paths
- Check if paths exist on target servers

**Slow Performance:**
- Large directories may take time to count
